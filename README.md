## Cattery SAAS

Cattery is a personal project I've been working on with the aim of keeping my skills up to date and trying some new technologies such as Aspire, Auth0 and Stripe integration.

## Architecture

Cattery is a smaller scope project with just a single database and API. My intention was to compare the use of Angular and Blazor for SAAS applications.

I decided to use the new Aspire service for both working locally and in Azure for deploying to Azure Container Apps. Even though this applications size doesn't necessarily require it.

## Future plans

The app is still in the very early stages of development, but my plan is to add booking functionality and simple reporting. I also want to add a simple administration area.
